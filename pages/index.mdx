**Azuro** is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on democratization and innovation in betting.
A bet is one of the first forms of contract used by people thousands of years ago. Today, however, Azuro is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on democratization and innovation in betting.
 online betting is plagued by a lack of transparency & fairness, much because it's a system built on negative incentives putting bookmakers & players against each other. At the same time, decentralized betting never took off due to inefficient liquidity solutions, resulting in a lack of betting markets and very poor UX. To top it all off - come the infinite unrealized possibilities within web3 and GameFi for betting to take shapes not yet imagined.
